PySql
=====

PySql is a test tool to generate MySql Queries from a certain format text.  
It's created for generating random data for test.

TODOs:
- Random relationship (between 2 tables) generating support.
- Introduction to input text's format.
- Powerful random sequence generating, like ['A1','A2',...]
- Fully documentation and a totally rewrite. I'm a XPer.
- Config file support, storing various SQL implementation's syntaxs, and formatting info.
